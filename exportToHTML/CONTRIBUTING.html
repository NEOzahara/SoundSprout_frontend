<span class="s0">### Before you contribute</span>
<span class="s0">Before we can use your code, you must sign the</span>
<span class="s0">[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement]</span>
<span class="s0">(https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)</span>
<span class="s0">(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the</span>
<span class="s0">copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our</span>
<span class="s0">codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also</span>
<span class="s0">need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you</span>
<span class="s0">know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign</span>
<span class="s0">the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has</span>
<span class="s0">approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.</span>
<span class="s0">Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with</span>
<span class="s0">us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and</span>
<span class="s0">possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid</span>
<span class="s0">frustration later on.</span>

<span class="s0">### Code reviews</span>
<span class="s0">All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We</span>
<span class="s0">use Github pull requests for this purpose.</span>

<span class="s0">### The small print</span>
<span class="s0">Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than</span>
<span class="s0">the one above, the</span>
<span class="s0">[Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement]</span>
