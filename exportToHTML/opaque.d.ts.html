<span class="s0">Create an opaque type, which hides its internal details from the public, and can only be created by being used explicitly.</span>

<span class="s0">The generic type parameter can be anything. It doesn't have to be an object.</span>

<span class="s0">[Read more about opaque types.](https://codemix.com/opaque-types-in-javascript/)</span>

<span class="s0">There have been several discussions about adding this feature to TypeScript via the `opaque type` operator, similar to how Flow does it. Unfortunately, nothing has (yet) moved forward:</span>
	<span class="s0">- [Microsoft/TypeScript#15408](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/15408)</span>
	<span class="s0">- [Microsoft/TypeScript#15807](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/15807)</span>

<span class="s1">@example</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>
<span class="s0">import {Opaque} from 'type-fest';</span>

<span class="s0">type AccountNumber = Opaque&lt;number, 'AccountNumber'&gt;;</span>
<span class="s0">type AccountBalance = Opaque&lt;number, 'AccountBalance'&gt;;</span>

<span class="s0">// The Token parameter allows the compiler to differentiate between types, whereas &quot;unknown&quot; will not. For example, consider the following structures:</span>
<span class="s0">type ThingOne = Opaque&lt;string&gt;;</span>
<span class="s0">type ThingTwo = Opaque&lt;string&gt;;</span>

<span class="s0">// To the compiler, these types are allowed to be cast to each other as they have the same underlying type. They are both `string &amp; { __opaque__: unknown }`.</span>
<span class="s0">// To avoid this behaviour, you would instead pass the &quot;Token&quot; parameter, like so.</span>
<span class="s0">type NewThingOne = Opaque&lt;string, 'ThingOne'&gt;;</span>
<span class="s0">type NewThingTwo = Opaque&lt;string, 'ThingTwo'&gt;;</span>

<span class="s0">// Now they're completely separate types, so the following will fail to compile.</span>
<span class="s0">function createNewThingOne (): NewThingOne {</span>
	<span class="s0">// As you can see, casting from a string is still allowed. However, you may not cast NewThingOne to NewThingTwo, and vice versa.</span>
	<span class="s0">return 'new thing one' as NewThingOne;</span>
<span class="s0">}</span>

<span class="s0">// This will fail to compile, as they are fundamentally different types.</span>
<span class="s0">const thingTwo = createNewThingOne() as NewThingTwo;</span>

<span class="s0">// Here's another example of opaque typing.</span>
<span class="s0">function createAccountNumber(): AccountNumber {</span>
	<span class="s0">return 2 as AccountNumber;</span>
<span class="s0">}</span>

<span class="s0">function getMoneyForAccount(accountNumber: AccountNumber): AccountBalance {</span>
	<span class="s0">return 4 as AccountBalance;</span>
<span class="s0">}</span>

<span class="s0">// This will compile successfully.</span>
<span class="s0">getMoneyForAccount(createAccountNumber());</span>

<span class="s0">// But this won't, because it has to be explicitly passed as an `AccountNumber` type.</span>
<span class="s0">getMoneyForAccount(2);</span>

<span class="s0">// You can use opaque values like they aren't opaque too.</span>
<span class="s0">const accountNumber = createAccountNumber();</span>

<span class="s0">// This will not compile successfully.</span>
<span class="s0">const newAccountNumber = accountNumber + 2;</span>

<span class="s0">// As a side note, you can (and should) use recursive types for your opaque types to make them stronger and hopefully easier to type.</span>
<span class="s0">type Person = {</span>
	<span class="s0">id: Opaque&lt;number, Person&gt;;</span>
	<span class="s0">name: string;</span>
<span class="s0">};</span>
<span class="s0">```</span>
