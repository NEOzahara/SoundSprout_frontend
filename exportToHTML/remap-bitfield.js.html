<span class="s2">/**</span>
 <span class="s2">* We must remap all the old bits to new bits for each set variant</span>
 <span class="s2">* Only arbitrary variants are considered as those are the only</span>
 <span class="s2">* ones that need to be re-sorted at this time</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* An iterated process that removes and sets individual bits simultaneously</span>
 <span class="s2">* will not work because we may have a new bit that is also a later old bit</span>
 <span class="s2">* This means that we would be removing a previously set bit which we don't</span>
 <span class="s2">* want to do</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* For example (assume `bN` = `1&lt;&lt;N`)</span>
 <span class="s2">* Given the &quot;total&quot; mapping `[[b1, b3], [b2, b4], [b3, b1], [b4, b2]]`</span>
 <span class="s2">* The mapping is &quot;total&quot; because:</span>
 <span class="s2">* 1. Every input and output is accounted for</span>
 <span class="s2">* 2. All combinations are unique</span>
 <span class="s2">* 3. No one input maps to multiple outputs and vice versa</span>
 <span class="s2">* And, given an offset with all bits set:</span>
 <span class="s2">* V = b1 | b2 | b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* Let's explore the issue with removing and setting bits simultaneously:</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~b1 | b3 = b2 | b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~b2 | b4 = b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~b3 | b1 = b1 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~b4 | b2 = b1 | b2</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* As you can see, we end up with the wrong result.</span>
 <span class="s2">* This is because we're removing a bit that was previously set.</span>
 <span class="s2">* And, thus the final result is missing b3 and b4.</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* Now, let's explore the issue with removing the bits first:</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~b1 = b2 | b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~b2 = b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~b3 = b4</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~b4 = 0</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* And then setting the bits:</span>
 <span class="s2">* V | b3 = b3</span>
 <span class="s2">* V | b4 = b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">* V | b1 = b1 | b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">* V | b2 = b1 | b2 | b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* We get the correct result because we're not removing any bits that were</span>
 <span class="s2">* previously set thus properly remapping the bits to the new order</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* To collect this into a single operation that can be done simultaneously</span>
 <span class="s2">* we must first create a mask for the old bits that are set and a mask for</span>
 <span class="s2">* the new bits that are set. Then we can remove the old bits and set the new</span>
 <span class="s2">* bits simultaneously in a &quot;single&quot; operation like so:</span>
 <span class="s2">* OldMask = b1 | b2 | b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">* NewMask = b3 | b4 | b1 | b2</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* So this:</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~oldMask | newMask</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* Expands to this:</span>
 <span class="s2">* V &amp; ~b1 &amp; ~b2 &amp; ~b3 &amp; ~b4 | b3 | b4 | b1 | b2</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* Which becomes this:</span>
 <span class="s2">* b1 | b2 | b3 | b4</span>
 <span class="s2">*</span>
 <span class="s2">* Which is the correct result!</span>
